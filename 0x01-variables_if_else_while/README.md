## Tasks:

### Mandatory Tasks:

- 0-positive_or_negative.c: Assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. 
   - Print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
      - The output of the program should be:
                        - The number, followed by
                        - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
                        - if the number is 0: is zero
                        - if the number is less than 0: is negative 
                        - followed by a new line

- 1-last_digit.c: Assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. 
    - Print whether the last digit of the number stored in the variable n is greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 and not 0.
       - The output of the program should be:
                               - The string Last digit of, followed by
                               - n, followed by
                               - the string 'is', followed by
                               - if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
                               - if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
                               - if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
                               - followed by a new line
             
- 2-print_alphabet.c:  Print the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using putchar.

- 3-print_alphabets.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using putchar.

- 4-print_alphabt.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, except the letters q and e using putchar.

- 5-print_numbers.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

- 6-print_numberz.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using putchar, without using a variable of type char.

- 7-print_tebahpla.c - prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using putchar.

- 8-print_base16.c - prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using putchar.

- 9-print_comb.c - prints all single-digit numbers, separated by a comma, using putchar, without using a variable of type char.
 
### Advanced Tasks:

- 100-print_comb3.c - prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by a comma, using putchar, without using a variable of type char.

- 101-print_comb4.c - prints all possible different combinations of three digits, separated by a comma, using putchar, without using a variable of type char. 

- 102-print_comb5.c - prints all possible different combinations of two two digit numbers, separated by a comma, using putchar, without using a variable of type char.
